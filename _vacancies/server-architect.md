#### What your day looks like

Monday morning 09:12, No alerts, but you quickly check the status of the servers. Everything is running smooth, as expected. Next up is the first scrum-meeting of the week. This week is all about optimizing the Cassandra configuration with the upcoming release and prepare the gradual roll-out of the new configuration to all machines. No time to lose, you put on your headphones and go to work!

After reviewing the weekend during lunch, you have a skype session with Ruben, who’s working at home today. Together you have a discussion about replacing Docker with Rocket. You decide that you will setup a test environment to get a better understanding of the implications of switching. At 16:00 you have some spare time and decide to  take a closer look at socketplane.
